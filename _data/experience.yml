    As part of the Cloud Engineering & Operations, my team is responsible for providing internal tools for networking and security. I work with a highly skilled team on technologies like AWS, Akamai, SSL, DNS.
    - I own the design and development of the internal certificate management tool which serves 1000s of certificates across Intuit through CAs like DigiCert and Amazon. This system must be highly available and robust due to its criticality.
    - I customized our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and AWS (CodeDeploy) and drove its adoption. Post adoption, developers saved nearly 30 minutes per deployment, while scaling up number of deployments done. Reliability of systems improved due to automated rolling deployment, health tests and automated rolling rollback in case of issues.
    - Automated AWS EC2 Hygiene (EC2 AMI refreshing) which saves 8-10 developer hours every month per team, while improving security and compliance by having latest OS patches applied regularly.
