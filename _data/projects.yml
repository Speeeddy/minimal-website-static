    As part of this project, the team developed a web application, a mobile application, and a REST API layer to facilitate file transfers between heterogenous devices. A need for such an application was felt during college by our collective experiences while sharing images of notes before examinations. When transferring from phone to another device like a laptop, the usual steps involved either opening mail application, attaching image, typing in the recepient email and sending. This application reduced effort and was a successful and extensive proof-of-concept. Project was built using Python, Node JS, Java and AWS.

    The chess logic has been coded from scratch in C#. This game was playable online with two users, choosing white and black. A headset had to be worn while playing, and the chess pieces were moved by focusing the headset on a piece and then to the chess board location. Unity3D, GoogleVR and Firebase Realtime Database were important technologies used for this project.
